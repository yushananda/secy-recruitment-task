The new movie ‘Once upon a time in ProgLand’ just hit the theatres and everyone is excited! Laila and Majnu thought it would be a great idea to watch it together on their first date (should set the mood for later). There is also a special discount for couples. This ticket costs X rupees. Laila and Majnu keep a X rupee and 2X rupee note in their wallets respectively and leave. But now that they’ve reached there, they see a huge queue outside the couples’ section. There are N couples present (including them). The cashier has run out of cash and therefore cannot give change to everyone. All the couples have 3X cash - one person with a X rupee note and the other with a 2X rupee note. One simple solution for the cashier’s problem is to take X from one person and return it to the partner who gives 2X (Note that each person must pay for themselves). Now suppose the N couples stand in random order in a queue (a person may or may not be with their partner). Cashier has 0 rupees to begin with. Find the number of possibilities in which the cashier will be able to give tickets to everyone.
