The central idea to solving the problem is to realise that for each '2X' person that comes, at least one corresponding 'X' person must have been ahead of them in the line. The answer to this problem is simply the n<sup>th</sup> [catalan number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number). The solution employs the use of a recursive function that returns the n<sup>th</sup> catalan number. One may also calculate the value of "2n choose n times n!", if they already know the closed form.
